I think I can be pretty efficient about computing the number of repeated
sequences in a given number of digits. I also think that can be extended to
allow for an upper and/or lower bound within the band.

Assuming the ranges are non-intersecting, which follows from the problem
statement of ranges being leftover, this would be approximately linear runtime
over the number of ranges.
